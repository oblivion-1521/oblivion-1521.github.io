About me
=========
I am Jiajie Li, a sophomore in Biomedical Engineering ([Qiming College](https://qiming.hust.edu.cn/)) at HUST. 
My undergraduate focus remained on mastering technical skills and research, which took precedence over extracurricular administration.

My current research focuses on **Positron Emission Tomography (PET)**, specifically in image reconstruction, registration algorithms and its applications in proton therapy monitoring. I'm a quick, clever, and resilient  learner, fueled by strong logic and creative problem-solving. 

I enjoy playing Texas Hold'em, guitar, and table tennis. I love chatting with people. 


Skills
=========
- Programming: 
  - mainly C++
  - use Python, Matlab, Shell scripting occasionally.
- Other tools: 
  - LaTeX
  - Vim
  - I'm familiar with the Linux operating system, and I use Git and Github for version control. 


Currently working on 
=========
- Developing foundational knowledge in Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming ([CMU15-418](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15418-s18/www/schedule.html)).
- learning [data structures](https://labuladong.online/algo/intro/quick-learning-plan/).
